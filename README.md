# EFCore Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises for learning **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** in C#.  
The goal is to practice and understand the main features of EF Core by building small examples and testing functionality step by step.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **EFCore.Console**  
  A console application for running EF Core queries and testing features.

- **EFCore.Data**  
  Contains the data access layer (DbContext, migrations, database setup).

- **EFCore.Domain**  
  Contains domain models (entities, relationships, configurations).

---

## üöÄ Features Explored

This repo demonstrates and experiments with different EF Core features, such as:

- Setting up DbContext and configuring models
- Querying data with LINQ
- Relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Migrations and database updates
- New EF Core 7 features:
  - `ExecuteUpdate`
  - `ExecuteDelete`
- Basic repository pattern

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- [.NET 6/7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- EF Core tools:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
  ```
